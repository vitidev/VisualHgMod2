# Mercurial Source Control Plugin for MS Visual Studio 2017/1019 #

Fork of https://github.com/JPAhnen/VisualHG2015

(Google Translate)
I do not know how to write extensions, so I only tried fix a bugs for personal use (vs2017/vs2019). As a result:

* removed support for older versions of the visual studio
* It works on projects with new *.csproj 
(also show status icon on folders based on inner content (experimental))
